	abstract = {Modern biological tools generate a wealth of data on metabolite
	            and protein concentrations that can be used to help inform new
	            strain designs. However, integrating these data sources to
	            generate predictions of steady-state metabolism typically
	            requires a kinetic description of the enzymatic reactions that
	            occur within a cell. Parameterizing these kinetic models from
	            biological data can be computationally difficult, especially as
	            the amount of data increases. Robust methods must also be able to
	            quantify the uncertainty in model parameters as a function of the
	            available data, which can be particularly computationally
	            intensive. The field of Bayesian inference offers a wide range of
	            methods for estimating distributions in parameter uncertainty.
	            However, these techniques are poorly suited to kinetic metabolic
	            modeling due to the complex kinetic rate laws typically employed
	            and the resulting dynamic system that must be solved. In this
	            paper, we employ linear-logarithmic kinetics to simplify the
	            calculation of steady-state flux distributions and enable
	            efficient sampling and variational inference methods. We
	            demonstrate that detailed information on the posterior
	            distribution of kinetic model parameters can be obtained
	            efficiently at a variety of different problem scales, including
	            large-scale kinetic models trained on multiomics datasets. These
	            results allow modern Bayesian machine learning tools to be
	            leveraged in understanding biological data and developing new,
	            efficient strain designs.},
